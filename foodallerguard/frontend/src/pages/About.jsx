          The concept for FoodAllerGuard began around 2024. We were having lunch at a restaurant when, suddenly, one of our members had an adverse reaction to the item they were eating. After the affected individual received all relevant care, we were able to determine why they had that reaction: the allergens were not clearly listed in the menu. Hence, FoodAllerGuard came into being, a web app (soon to be mobile) that allows users to upload photos of their menus or menu PDFs and learn exactly which allergens  are present in the food that can affect them.
